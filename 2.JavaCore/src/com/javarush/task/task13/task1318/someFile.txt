Living in a city has both advantages and disadvantages.
On the plus sideit is often easier to find work, and there is usually a choice ofpublic transport, so you don't need to own a car.
Also there are a lotof interesting things to do and places to see.
For example, you can eatin good restaurants, visit museums, and go to the theatre and toconcerts.
What is more, when you want to relax, you can usually find apark where you can feed the ducks or just sit on a park bench and read abook.
All in all, city life is full of bustle and variety and you neednever feel bored.
However, for every plus there is a minus. For one thing, unless your jobis very well-paid, you will not be able to afford many of the thingsthat there are to do, because living in a city is often very expensive.
It is particularly difficult to find good, cheap accommodation.
What ismore, public transport is sometimes crowded and dirty, particularly inthe rush hour, and even the parks can be crowded, especially on Sundayswhen it seems that every city-dweller is looking for some open space andgreen grass.
Last of all, despite all the crowds, it is still possibleto feel very lonely in a city.
In a world, I think that city life can be particularly appealing toyoung people, who like the excitement of the city and don't mind thenoise and pollution.
However, many people, when they get older, andparticularly when they have young children, often prefer the peace andfresh air of the countryside.
